# Final Setup Steps - Using Your Existing Resources

You already have everything connected! âœ…

## What's Already Set Up

âœ… **D1 Database**: `community_db` (bound as `DB`)  
âœ… **KV Namespace**: `ttt-rate-limit` (bound as `TYLERS_TECH_KV`)  
âœ… **Admin Key**: Set in environment variables  
âœ… **Feedback Admin Key**: Set in environment variables

## Only 1 Step Remaining: Run Database Migration

### Open Your D1 Console

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ **D1** â†’ **community_db**
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Copy the contents of `RUN_IN_D1_CONSOLE.sql` (from this repo)
4. Paste into the console query editor
5. Click **Execute**

This will add all the advanced features to your existing database:
- âœ… Users & authentication tables
- âœ… Voting & reputation system
- âœ… Badges (6 default badges)
- âœ… Moderation tools (3 default spam keywords)
- âœ… File attachments support
- âœ… Notifications system
- âœ… Bookmarks
- âœ… Audit logging
- âœ… Page comments

### Verify Migration Worked

After running the SQL, execute this query in the console:

```sql
SELECT * FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version;
```

You should see 8 rows (versions 2-8).

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

Your site is now fully configured with:

## Optional: Add R2 for File Uploads

If you want users to upload images/files:

1. **R2** â†’ **Create bucket** â†’ Name: `tylers-tech-uploads`
2. **Pages** â†’ Your project â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Functions**
3. **R2 bucket bindings** â†’ **Add binding**:
