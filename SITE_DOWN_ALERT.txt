URGENT: SITE IS COMPLETELY DOWN!
==================================

The screenshots show ERR_FAILED errors - this means:
- The domain isn't resolving to Cloudflare Pages
- OR Cloudflare Pages project is stopped/deleted
- OR there's a DNS misconfiguration

IMMEDIATE CHECKS NEEDED:
========================

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard  Pages
   - Is 'tylerstechtips-official' project still there?
   - What's the deployment status?
   - Are there any error messages?

2. Check Custom Domains in Pages:
   - Click on the project  Custom domains tab
   - Is 'tylerstechtips.com' listed?
   - What status does it show?

3. Check DNS Settings:
   - Cloudflare Dashboard  DNS  Records
   - Look for tylerstechtips.com
   - Is there a CNAME record pointing to tylerstechtips-official.pages.dev?

4. Try the default domain:
   - Visit: https://tylerstechtips-official.pages.dev
   - Does THIS work?

If the .pages.dev domain works but tylerstechtips.com doesn't,
then it's a DNS/custom domain configuration issue.

ACTION NEEDED: Check your Cloudflare dashboard now!
