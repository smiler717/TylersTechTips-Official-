ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
================

Your custom domain (tylerstechtips.com) is pointing to a DIFFERENT Cloudflare Pages 
project than tylerstechtips-official.pages.dev!

This means:
 tylerstechtips-official.pages.dev = Has the latest code (navigation fixed)
 tylerstechtips.com = Has OLD code (broken navigation)

SOLUTION:
=========

You need to attach tylerstechtips.com to the CORRECT Pages project.

Steps:
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard  Pages
2. Click on 'tylerstechtips-official' project
3. Go to Custom Domains tab
4. Add 'tylerstechtips.com' 
5. Remove it from any other Pages project if it exists there

OR find which project tylerstechtips.com is attached to and:
1. Remove it from the old project
2. Add it to 'tylerstechtips-official' project

QUICK TEST:
===========
1. Visit: https://tylerstechtips-official.pages.dev
   - Does navigation work? (should work)

2. Visit: https://tylerstechtips.com
   - Does navigation work? (currently broken)

If #1 works but #2 doesn't, that confirms the custom domain is 
pointing to the wrong project!

Let me know if you need help moving the custom domain...
