# ðŸš€ Database Migration - Step by Step Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through updating your Cloudflare D1 database to support the new user authentication system.

**Time Required:** ~5 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy (Copy & Paste)

---

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- Access to your Cloudflare Dashboard
- The database name for your Tyler's Tech Tips site

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Login with your account
3. Navigate to **Workers & Pages** (left sidebar)

### Step 2: Access Your D1 Database
1. Click on **D1** in the Workers & Pages section
2. You should see your database listed (probably named something like `tylers-tech-db` or `TYLERS_TECH_DB`)
3. Click on your database name to open it

### Step 3: Open the SQL Console
1. Once in your database, click on the **Console** tab at the top
2. You should see a SQL query editor

### Step 4: Run the Migration Script

**Option A: Run All at Once (Recommended)**
1. Open the file `migrate-database.sql` in this folder
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
3. Paste into the Cloudflare D1 Console
4. Click **Execute** or press Ctrl+Enter

**Option B: Run Commands One by One (Safer)**
Copy and run each section from `migrate-database.sql` individually:

1. **Create users table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  display_name TEXT,
  bio TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  last_login INTEGER,
  is_verified INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```
Click Execute âœ“

2. **Create indexes for users:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_created ON users(created_at);
```
Click Execute âœ“

3. **Create page_comments table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS page_comments (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  slug TEXT NOT NULL,
  author TEXT,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_by TEXT,
  parent_id TEXT,
  user_id TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```
Click Execute âœ“

4. **Create indexes for page_comments:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_page_comments_slug ON page_comments(slug);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_page_comments_created ON page_comments(created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_page_comments_parent ON page_comments(parent_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_page_comments_user ON page_comments(user_id);
```
Click Execute âœ“

5. **Add user_id to existing tables:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE comments ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_topics_user ON topics(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_comments_user ON comments(user_id);
```
Click Execute âœ“

> **Note:** If you see an error about "duplicate column name", that's okay! It means the column already exists.

---

## âœ… Verification

After running the migration, verify everything worked:

1. Run this query in the console:
```sql
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ORDER BY name;
```

You should see these tables:
- âœ“ comments
- âœ“ feedback
- âœ“ page_comments
- âœ“ topics
- âœ“ users

2. Check the users table structure:
```sql
PRAGMA table_info(users);
```

You should see columns: id, username, email, password_hash, display_name, bio, avatar_url, created_at, last_login, is_verified

3. Check page_comments has user_id:
```sql
PRAGMA table_info(page_comments);
```

You should see a `user_id` column in the list.

## ðŸ§ª Test the Authentication System

1. **Visit your profile page:**  
   https://tylerstechti.ps/profile.html

2. **Register a new account:**
   - Click the "Register" tab
   - Enter username, email, password
   - Click "Create Account"

3. **Login:**
   - Enter your username and password
   - Click "Login"
   - You should see your profile page

4. **Test commenting:**
   - Go to any article (like cpu-2025.html)
   - You should see your name pre-filled in the comment box
   - Post a test comment
   - The comment should show your display name

5. **Verify in database:**
```sql
SELECT id, author, user_id, body, created_at 
FROM page_comments 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

Your new comment should have a `user_id` that matches your user account!

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

You should now see:
- **Join Community** button in the navbar (when logged out)
- Your **profile avatar/name** in the navbar (when logged in)
- Comments automatically use your profile name
- Full user profile management at /profile.html

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Column already exists" error
- **Solution:** This is okay! It means the migration was already partially run. Continue with the next commands.

### "No such table" error
- **Solution:** Make sure you're running the CREATE TABLE commands first, before the ALTER TABLE commands.

### Can't see the Join Community button
- **Solution:** Clear your browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Login not working
- **Solution:** 
  1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
  2. Verify the `users` table was created
  3. Make sure your Cloudflare Pages deployment is complete

### Comments not linking to user_id
- **Solution:**
  1. Make sure you're logged in
  2. Check that the `page_comments` table has the `user_id` column
  3. Verify your auth token in localStorage (F12 â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage â†’ look for `tt_auth_token`)

---

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
2. Check the Cloudflare D1 query results for error messages
3. Verify all tables were created successfully
4. Make sure your Cloudflare Pages deployment completed

---

## ðŸ”„ Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong and you need to revert:

```sql
-- WARNING: This will delete all user accounts and associations!
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN user_id;  -- May not work on older SQLite
ALTER TABLE comments DROP COLUMN user_id;  -- May not work on older SQLite
```

Note: SQLite in some versions doesn't support DROP COLUMN. If that fails, you'll need to recreate the tables without the user_id column.

---

**Migration Complete! ðŸŽŠ**

Your site now has a full user authentication system with profile management!
